excerpt: 'We discovered a novel mechanism by which the macrophage ERK5-NRF2 axis develops a unique senescence-associated secretory phenotype/stemness phenotype by upregulating AHR to engender atherogenesis. The finding of senescence-associated stemness phenotype provides a molecular explanation to resolve the paradox of senescence in proliferative plaque by permitting myeloid cells to escape the senescence-induced cell cycle arrest during atherosclerosis formation.'
