I am an interdisciplinary computational biologist with over a decade of experience bridging computer science and life sciences. My doctoral training in computer science focused on developing machine learning algorithms for biomedical applications, including clinical data integration and medical diagnostics. Since joining Houston Methodist Research Institute as a postdoctoral fellow, I have applied and expanded my expertise in deep learning and molecular biology, collaborating closely with clinicians and experimental scientists to uncover meaningful biological insights. My work has been published in several high-impact journals, such as <em>Nature Biotechnology</em>, <em>Circulation</em>, <em>Nature Metabolism</em>, and <em>Circulation Research</em>.

Beyond my research, I have served in editorial and community roles, such as reviewing manuscripts for Nature Communications, IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics, and PLOS Computational Biology, and working as a Program Committee member for conferences such as the International Workshop on Data Mining in Bioinformatics. Moving forward, I aim to harness advanced computational approachesâ€”particularly in the areas of RNA therapeutics and precision medicine to deepen our understanding of molecular biology and accelerate the translation of these insights into novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.
